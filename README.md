## Description:
I've always didn't like instagram, every new update they copy a different app instead of making theirs better. Instagram used to be used soley to post pictures but now you have shorts, stories, and marketplace, which wouldn't be a problem if they integrated it properly but it feels like they just jammed it in. So I'm going to make a Clone of Instagram but without the extra fluff.
